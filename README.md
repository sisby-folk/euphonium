Charmonium (and by extension this mod) adds biome, structure, and world feature-specific ambient sound to minecraft.

All types of ambience are toggleable, and by default the volume can be tweaked through the Ambient Sounds slider.

### Design

This is a backport of the very shiny post-refactor version of Charmonium.

It's adapted to use Quilt Config ([Kaleido](https://github.com/sisby-folk/kaleido-config)) for a simple load-time toml configuration.

### Afterword

All mods are built on the work of many others.

This mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.

We're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.
